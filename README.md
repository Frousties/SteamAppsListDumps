# SteamAppsListDumps

Dumps generated by my SteamAppsList project

Steam application listing with their associated type (game, dlc..)

Data gathered from `https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?filters=basic&appids=` + appid

The dump names are explicit:

* app_list: All apps
* game_list: Only where type = game
* not_games: Only where type != game

Feel free to ask me or contribute to SteamAppsList for more formats
